HOSTOS GAME DESIGN FAQ

What exactly is Game Design anyways?

Game Design is field of design based on the ability to craft playful systems involving player input with a desired outcome.  Game designers must be able to think in terms of abstractions, anticipating the kinds of choices a player might make while playing a game.  In order to implement their designs, students in the Game Design Program will need to be knowledgeable of a number of topics in diverse fields such as graphic design, computer science, sound design and writing.

Playing games is not the same thing as Game Design.  Being good at playing games does not necessarily mean one will excel as a game designer.  Designing and developing a game from the ground up is hard work!  It takes perseverance to succeed at creating games and other elaborate multimedia projects.
